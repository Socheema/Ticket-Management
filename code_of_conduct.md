# Contributor Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every contributor and want to create a welcoming and respectful community for all. We ask everyone participating in the project to abide by the following Code of Conduct.

## Our standards

- Be respectful and considerate in communication and collaboration.
- Be inclusive: welcome people from diverse backgrounds and experiences.
- Use constructive language for feedback. Focus on the work, not the person.
- Assume good intentions. Ask clarifying questions before escalating.

## Unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or abusive language.
- Violent or sexually explicit language or imagery.
- Deliberate intimidation or stalking.
- Degrading comments about a person or a protected class.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers so the team can address it. Options:

- Open a private issue on GitHub and mark it `private` or `confidential` (or contact a maintainer directly via their GitHub account)
- Email the maintainers (replace `maintainers@example.com` with the appropriate contact before publishing).

All reports will be reviewed and treated seriously. The maintainers will respond and take appropriate action, which may include removal from the project.

## Enforcement

The maintainers are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. They may take actions such as:

- Asking the participant to modify their behavior
- Temporarily or permanently banning the participant from the project
- Closing or blocking abusive content

## Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct is adapted from commonly used community conduct policies. Please replace contact details with the preferred reporting channel for your project.
